A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```
# DP
**The same as #70 climbing stairs**
>* ```dp[1] = 1``` means the first element have 1 solution; ```dp[0] = 1``` is used for calculate ```dp[2]```, which may equals to ```dp[0] + dp[1]```
>* There are two general situations: one is ```s[i]=0```, another is not
>>* ```s[i]=0```: if ```s[i - 1] =="0" or "1"```, ```s[i]``` can combined with ```s[i - 1]```, thus ```dp[i + 1] = dp[i - 1]```; otherwise, decode fail ```return 0```
>>* ```s[i]!=0```, if ```s[i - 1] =="1", or ```s[i-1]="2" and ```s[i] in "123456"```, current element can be decoded alone(```dp[i + 1] = dp[i]```) or combined with previous element(```dp[i + 1] = dp[i-1]```)

```python
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if(not s or s[0]=="0"):
            return 0
        dp = [0 for i in range(len(s) + 1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == "0":
                if s[i - 1] == "2" or s[i - 1] == "1":
                    dp[i + 1] = dp[i - 1] # current position can only be combined with s[i - 1]
                else:
                    return 0
            elif s[i - 1] == "1" or (s[i - 1] == "2" and s[i] in "123456"):
                dp[i + 1] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i] # current position can alone(dp[i]) or combined with s[i - 1] (dp[i - 1])
            else:
                dp[i + 1] = dp[i]
        return dp[-1]
```
