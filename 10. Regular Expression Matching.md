Given an input string ```(s)``` and a pattern ```(p)```, implement regular expression matching with support for ```'.'``` and``` '*'```.
```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
```
Note:
```
s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
```
**Example1**
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
**Example2**
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```
**Example3**
```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```
**Example4**
```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
```
**Example5**
```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```
## 1. Recursion
1. To implement simple **regular expressions**. You need to implement ``` '.' ``` and ```'*'```, where``` '.' ```Can represent any character, and ```'*'``` means that the previous character appears 0 or any number of times. 
2. First thought of **greedy and exhaustive methods**, but considering things like ```'. *'``` That can be turned into arbitrary strings, it is difficult to exhaust. 
3. Consider other methods, of which **recursion** is one, and divide the problem into sub-problems to consider. In general, recursion can be converted into **DP**. DP can **sacrafice** space for time. (Due to the long recursion time, the time may exceed the limit.) 
### Process
1. if s == None -> P == None
```python
if len(p) == 0: return len(s) == 0
```
2. Compare the first char in S and P, record
P[0] only has two situations : a. == s[0]; b. == ```'.'```, representing any chars.
```
flag = len(s) != 0 and p[0] in {s[0], '.'}
```
3. When ```p[1] = '*'```, there are two situations:
>* the previous char exists 0 time, which means s stand still, p moves forward to p[2](including '*'), then compare p[2:] and s recursively.

>* the previous chr exists 1 time, then p stand still and s move frorward one character, then compare s[1:] and p recursively.
>> **Note: In this situation, remeber to check flag, making sure previous patterns match when move to next step**

4.  if p[1]!='*', then compare s[1:] and p[1:] recursively
```java
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s, p):
        if len(p) == 0: return len(s) == 0
        flag = len(s) != 0 and p[0] in {s[0], '.'}
        if len(p) >=2 and p[1] == '*':
            return (flag and self.isMatch(s[1:], p) or (self.isMatch(s, p[2:])))
        else:
            return flag and self.isMatch(s[1:], p[1:])
```
## 2. DP
1. ```dp[i][j] ```represents the truth value of whther ```s[0:i] and p[0:j]``` matches.
2. When s is none, p must have``` '*'```, and it must be consistent with previous truth value. ```dp[0][i] = (p[i - 1] =='*' and dp[0][i - 2] and i > 2)```
3. when ```p = '*', dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2]``` or p[j - 2] is the same as s, so ```dp[i-1][j] and (s[i-1]==p[j-2] or p[j-2]=='.')```
4. If ```p != '*'```,compare the previous char directly, ```dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] and (p[j-1] == '.' or p[j-1] == s[i-1]```
5. Return the truth value ```s[0:len(s)]p[0:len(p)] = dp[len(s)]dp[len(j)]```
```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s, p):
    
        dp=[[False for i in range(len(p)+1)] for j in range(len(s)+1)]

        dp[0][0]=True

        for i in range(1,len(p)+1):
            dp[0][i] = p[i-1] == '*' and dp[0][i-2] and i>1
 
        for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
            for j in range(1,len(p)+1):

                if p[j-1]=='*':
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i][j-2] or (dp[i-1][j] and (s[i-1]==p[j-2] or p[j-2]=='.'))

                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] and (p[j-1] == '.' or p[j-1] == s[i-1])
        
        return dp[len(s)][len(p)]


```
