Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

**Note:**
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
# DP
>* three dimention, i: before day i; k: times of trade; 0/1: 0, no stock at present; 1,have stock at present
```
1. dp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i])
rest at day i: dp[i-1][k][0]; sell the current stock at day i:dp[i-1][k][1] + prices[i]

2. dp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k-1][0] - prices[i])
dp[i-1][k][1]:rest at day i; dp[i-1][k-1][0] - prices[i]: buy stock at day i
```
>* since every trade need buying and selling, so the maximum trade time should below ```len(prices)//2```, otherwise, it's the same as k = infinite
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k, prices):
        if not prices:
            return 0
        n = len(prices)
        max_k = n // 2        # maximum trade time
        
        if k >= max_k:      # k = infinite
            res = 0
            for i in range(n-1):
                res += max(0, prices[i+1]-prices[i])
            return res
        else:
            max_k = k

        dp = [[[0]*2 for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(max_k+1):
            dp[0][i][1] = -prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for k in range(1, max_k+1):
                dp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i-1][k][0], dp[i-1][k][1]+prices[i])
                dp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i-1][k][1], dp[i-1][k-1][0]-prices[i])
        return dp[n-1][max_k][0]
```
