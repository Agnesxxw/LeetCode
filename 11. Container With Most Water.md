Given n non-negative integers a~1~, a~2~, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a~i~). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, a~i~) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.


The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example**
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

>* First set the maximum length of the rectangle, that is ```len(height)```, right position should be ```height[len(height) - 1] ```, the right position is ```height[0]```
>* Move one side, since the rectangle length will decrease, so only by moving the shorter side will have the possibility that area increase 
 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxCon = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        while(left<right):
            maxCon = max(maxCon,(right-left)*min(height[left],height[right]))
	# move the shorter side
            if(height[left] < height[right]):
                left +=1
            else:
                right-=1
        return maxCon

```

>* If ```height[L] < height[R]```, move L, else move R. Say ```height[0] < height[5]```, area of (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1) will be smaller than (0, 5), so no need to try them.
>* actually the same as above
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        L, R, width, res = 0, len(height) - 1, len(height) - 1, 0
        for w in range(width, 0, -1):
            if height[L] < height[R]:
                res, L = max(res, height[L] * w), L + 1
            else:
                res, R = max(res, height[R] * w), R - 1
        return res
