Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.

The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
```

    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        nums1 = version1.split('.')
        nums2 = version2.split('.')
        l1 = len(nums1)
        l2 = len(nums2)
        for i in range(max(l1, l2)):
            i1 = int(nums1[i]) if i < l1 else 0
            i2 = int(nums2[i]) if i < l2 else 0
            if i1 != i2:
                return 1 if i1 > i2 else -1
        return 0
