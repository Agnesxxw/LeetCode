A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

For example,
Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

**Note:**
Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.

```python
class Solution:
    def strobogrammaticInRange(self, low: str, high: str) -> int:
        dict1 = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '8': '8', '9': '6'}
        n, low, high = len(high), int(low), int(high)
        res = set()
        if int(low) < 10:
            for k in [0, 1, 8]:
                if low <= k <= high:
                    res.add(k)

        def helper(n):
            nonlocal res
            if n == 0:
                return ['']
            if n == 1:
                return ['0', '1', '8']
            ans = []
            for i in helper(n - 2):
                for k, v in dict1.items():
                    tmp = v + i + k
                    ans.append(tmp)
                    if len(str(int(tmp))) == n and low <= int(tmp) <= high:
                        res.add(tmp)
            return ans

        helper(n)
        helper(n - 1)
        return len(res)
