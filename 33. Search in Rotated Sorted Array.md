Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., ```[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]``` might become ```[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]```).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return ```-1```.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

# Binary Search
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        start, last = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while start <= last:
            mid = (start + last) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            if nums[start] <= nums[mid]: # in the left ascending list
                if target < nums[mid] and target >= nums[start]:
                    last = mid - 1
                else:
                    start = mid + 1
            if nums[mid] <= nums[last]:# in the right ascending list (right ascending is smaller than left ascending)
                if target <= nums[last] and target > nums[mid]:
                    start = mid + 1
                else:
                    last = mid - 1
        return -1
```
## Update 

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        start = 0
        end = len(nums) - 1

        while ( start <= end ):
            mid = ( start + end ) // 2
            # found the element
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            # Couldn't find the element in the list, avoid extra search
            elif( start == mid == end ):
                return -1
            
            # start is less than mid, list is in increasing order                
            elif ( nums[start] <= nums[mid] ):
                
                # target is greater than equal to start & smaller than mid
                if( nums[start] <= target < nums[mid] ):
                    end = mid
                
                # target is smaller than start & mid
                # target is greater than start & greater than mid
                else:
                    start = mid + 1
            
            # start is greater than mid, list is pivoted
            else: #( nums[start] > nums[mid] ):
                # target is smaller than start & greater than mid
                if ( nums[mid] < target < nums[start] ):
                    start = mid + 1
                
                # target is smaller than start & smaller than mid
                # target is greater than start & greater than mid
                else:
                    end = mid

        return -1
