Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

**Example:**
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any ```'O'``` on the border of the board are not flipped to ```'X'```. Any ```'O'``` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an ```'O'``` on the border will be flipped to ```'X'```. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

# DFS
>* Let all the "O" on the board and its connections to another symbol. Since the boarder "O" means thay can 'percolate' so they aren't flipped to 'X'
>* Then change all the other 'O' to 'X'
>* At last change to the origine ones on the boarder 'O' and its connections
```
