Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array ```[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]```. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

**Example:**
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```
# Two sliding Window
>* We advance the left window as long as left_max (the tallest height we've encountered in the left window so far) is <= right_max (the tallest height encountered so far in the right window). The right window works the same way - we are always advancing the window that has the smaller maximum height (otherwise we would be added more units of water than is actually trapped).
>* While advancing the left window, if height[left] < left_max on a given iteration, then we add the difference in heights to trapped_water. Otherwise, left_max = height[left] and we add 0 to trapped_water. The right window works the same way.

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
	    # left advances the left window, right advances the right window
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1

		# left_max keeps track of the tallest height the left pointer has encountered,
		# right_max keeps track of the tallest height the right pointer has encountered,
		# and trapped_water keeps track of the number of units of trapped rain water
        left_max = right_max = trapped_water = 0
        while left < right:
		    # get the current highest evelation on the left and right windows
            left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
            right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
			
			# the smaller height side is the maximum amount of rain water that can be trapped
			# (otherwise we would incorrectly add water that would spill over the smaller height side),
			# so add the number of units of water trapped from the smaller height side
            if left_max <= right_max:
			    # this will add the water trapped in height[left] relative to the tallest height we've seen on
				# the left side so far
				# if left_max was previously smaller than height[left], this will be 0
                trapped_water += left_max - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                trapped_water += right_max - height[right]
                right -= 1
        return trapped_water
