Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
```python
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
**Example 2:**
```python
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
**Example 3:**
```python
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
## 1. Hash & DP: 
>* DP: S[n] only depends on S[n -1], S[n -1] only depends on S[n - 2]……
>* Hash table is used to store the used list
>* dp[j] = i -> s[i…j]is the longest substring without repeating, end with s[j], length = j - 1 + 1
>* when s[j+1] is not in the usedlist, dp[j+1]=dp[j]+1
>* when s[j+1] is in the usedlist, find the existed repeating index in usedlist, start a new substring from the last repeating index + 1(start)
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        used = {} # dic, existed char = key, value = index
        max_length = start = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s): 
            if c in used and start <= used[c]: 
                start = used[c] + 1 # if s[i + 1] is repeated, start new  unrepeated list from repeated char position + 1
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, i - start + 1)

            used[c] = i


        return max_length
```
### Discussion: why need to check start <= used[c]?
After we do start = usedChar[s[i]] + 1, there could be characters whose last seen indexes stored in usedChar are from before start. We don't want to consider those characters as repeats because we are only considering the substring from start to i each iteration.

## 2. Sliding Window
>* Start traversing the string from left to right and maintain track of:
>> 1. the current substring with non-repeating characters with the help of a start and end index: 
>>> i, j. If current char not existing in the window, j++, elase, i++
>> 2. the longest non-repeating substring output
>> 3. a lookup table of already visited characters
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        slen = len(s)
        if slen == 0:
            return 0
        i = j = 0
        charlist = ""
        maxlen = 0
        while i < slen and j < slen:
            if s[j] not in charlist: # j move to next
                charlist += s[j]
                maxlen = max(maxlen, j - i + 1)
                j += 1
            else:
                
                charlist = charlist[1:] #delete the ith element in front
                i += 1
        return maxlen
```
