There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
**Example 1:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

# Topology Sorting, BFS
>* First check if there is DAG, if there are cycles, it won't meet the prequisite
>>* Topology Sort: sort the DAG node, let u always exists before v on every edge (u, v) 
>* Use the prerequisites to obtain the adjacency list
>* first build the adjacent table; then pick all the node that do not have prequisite, put them in the queue; last, when queue is not empty, pop the queue head and delete this node in the prequisite list,

>> 当 queue 非空时，依次将队首节点出队，在课程安排图中删除此节点 pre：并不是真正从邻接表中删除此节点 pre，而是将此节点对应所有邻接节点 cur 的入度 −1,即 indegrees[cur] -= 1。
>> 当入度 −1后邻接节点 cur 的入度为0, 说明 cur 所有的前驱节点已经被 “删除”，此时将 cur 入队。
>> 在每次 pre 出队时，执行 numCourses--；
>> 若整个课程安排图是有向无环图（即可以安排），则所有节点一定都入队并出队过，即完成拓扑排序。换个角度说，若课程安排图中存在环，一定有节点的入度始终不为0。
>> 因此，拓扑排序出队次数等于课程个数，返回 numCourses == 0 判断课程是否可以成功安排。
