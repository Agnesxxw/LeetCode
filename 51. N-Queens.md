The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where ```'Q'``` and``` '.' ```both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
**Example:**
```
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

# DFS
>* ```nums[index]``` is column and index is actually the row. So, ````abs(nums[i]-nums[n])``` is the distance between columns, and ```n-i``` is the distance between rows --> checking if on same diagonal. (on the line with k = 1 or -1 = (y~2~ - y~1~)/(x~2~ - x~1~))
>* ```nums[i] == nums[n]``` checks if on same column --> we go through each row, so there is no need checking whether on the same row.

    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = []
        self.dfs([-1]*n, 0, [], res)
        return res
 
    # nums is a one-dimension array, like [1, 3, 0, 2] means
    # first queen is placed in column 1, second queen is placed
    # in column 3, etc.
    def dfs(self, nums, index, path, res):
        if index == len(nums):
            res.append(path) # Q is run out of 
            return  # backtracking
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums[index] = i # put Q in matrix[index][i]
            if self.valid(nums, index):  # pruning
                tmp = "."*len(nums)
                self.dfs(nums, index+1, path+[tmp[:i]+"Q"+tmp[i+1:]], res)

    # check whether nth queen can be placed in that column
    def valid(self, nums, n):
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(nums[i]-nums[n]) == n -i or nums[i] == nums[n]:
                return False
        return True
