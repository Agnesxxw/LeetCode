Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in ```O(1)``` space.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
# Mole Votes
>* the number that exists for more than ```1/m * length``` means that, at most ```m - 1``` such numbers exists. Here is 1/3, so at most it has two numbers meet the requirements
>* Mole Votes is to compare each number with the next one, if different, its ```valid votes -= 1```. At last, the nums with ```votes != 0``` has the possibility that it exceeds ```1/m * length```
>* ```count0```, ```count 1``` are to record how many current valid votes are these two number has (since 1/3 -> at most two numbers); ```cond0```, ```cond1``` are to record the current number value with positive valid votes
