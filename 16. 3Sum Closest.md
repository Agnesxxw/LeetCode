Given an array ```nums``` of n integers and an integer ```target```, find three integers in ```nums``` such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example**:
```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```
#
>* The same as #15, but need an extra diff to record best result
>* generate a huge integer:
```python
import sys
i = sys.maxsize
```
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        result, diff = 0, 10000000000
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:#if we have two same adjacent numbers, their result would have been computed when we did nums[i-1] so we just skip that i value
                continue

            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1

            while left < right:
                total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                hold_diff = abs (total - target)

                if not hold_diff:
                    return total

                if hold_diff  < diff:
                    result = total
                    diff = hold_diff

                if total < target: # since it's sorted, right has reached maximum
                    left += 1

                else:
                    right -= 1# left has reached minimum

        return result
