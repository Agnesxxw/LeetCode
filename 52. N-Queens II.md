The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

**Example:**
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```
# DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def totalNQueens(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = [0]
        def DFS(cos, xps, xms):
            i = len(cos)
            if i == n: 
                result[0] += 1
                return 
            for j in range(n):
                if j not in cos and i+j not in xps and i-j not in xms:
                    DFS(cos+[j], xps+[i+j], xms+[i-j])
        
        DFS([], [], [])
        return result[0]
