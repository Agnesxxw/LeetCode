Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**Example:**
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```
Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
# BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxEnd = start = end = step = 0
        while end < len(nums) - 1:
            maxEnd = end + 1
            step += 1
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                if i + nums[i] >= len(nums) - 1:
                    return step
                else:
                    maxEnd = max(i + nums[i], maxEnd)
            start = end + 1
            end = maxEnd
        return step

# Greedy
```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        size = len(nums)
        destination = size - 1     
        # record of current coverage, record of last jump index
        cur_coverage, last_jump_index = 0, 0
        step = 0
        # Quick response if start index == destination index == 0
        if size == 1:
            return 0
        # Greedy strategy: extend coverage as long as possible with lazy jump
        for i in range( 0, size):
            # extend current coverage as further as possible
            cur_coverage = max( cur_coverage, i + nums[i] )
            # update last jump index
            if i == last_jump_index:
                last_jump_index = cur_coverage
                step += 1
                # check if reached destination already
                if cur_coverage >= destination:
                        return step  
        return step
