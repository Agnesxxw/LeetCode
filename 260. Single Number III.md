Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]]
```
**Note:**
```
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

```python

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self,nums:List[int])-> int:
        count=[]
        for num in nums:
            if num in count:
                count.remove(num)
            else:
                count.append(num)
        return count

```
# Bit Calculation
>* ```bitmask ^= x```, the left elements are the element exists for odd times, so use this to get rid of teh elements exists for even times, but this will also keep the difference of x and y(exists for odd times)
>* ``` -x = ~x + 1```, ``` x & (-x)``` can keep the mostright 1, and set all other 1 to 0, so use this to devide x and y, ```bitmask & (-bitmask)``` keep the rightmost 1, which comes from eitehr x or y
>* Finding x, ```y = bitmskk ^ x```
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: int) -> List[int]:
        # difference between two numbers (x and y) which were seen only once
        bitmask = 0
        for num in nums:
            bitmask ^= num
        
        # rightmost 1-bit diff between x and y
        diff = bitmask & (-bitmask)
        
        x = 0
        for num in nums:
            # bitmask which will contain only x
            if num & diff:
                x ^= num
        
        return [x, bitmask^x]
```
