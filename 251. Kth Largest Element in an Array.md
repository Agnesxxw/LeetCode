Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.
**Example:**
```
Input: 2d vector =
[
  [1,2],
  [3],
  [4,5,6]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].
```

As an added challenge, try to code it using only iterators in C++ or iterators in Java.
```
```python
class Vector2D:

    def __init__(self, v: List[List[int]]):
        self.vector = v
        self.iterator = []
        for i in range(len(v)):
            for j in range(len(v[i])):
                self.iterator.append(v[i][j])
        self.cur = 0


    def next(self) -> int:
        self.cur += 1
        return self.iterator[self.cur - 1]

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        if self.cur >= len(self.iterator):
            return False
        return True



# Your Vector2D object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Vector2D(v)
# param_1 = obj.next()
# param_2 = obj.hasNext()
```
