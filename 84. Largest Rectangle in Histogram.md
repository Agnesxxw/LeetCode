Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
**Example:**
```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```
# Stack
>* The stack maintain the indexes of buildings with ascending height. Before adding a new building, pop the building who is taller than the new one. The building popped out represent the height of a rectangle with the new building as the right boundary and the current stack top as the left boundary. Calculate its area and update ans of maximum area. Boundary is handled using dummy buildings.
>* For any bar x, if it's in a rectangle of which the height is also the height of x, we know that every bar in the rectangle must be no shorter than x. Then the issue is to find the left and right boundary where the bars are shorter than x. According to the code, when a bar is popped out from the stack, we know it must be higher than the bar at position i, so bar[i] must be the right boundary (exclusive) of the rectangle, and the previous bar in the stack is the first one that is shorter than the popped one so it must be the left boundary (also exclusive). Then we find the rectangle.
```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        height.append(0)
        stack = [-1]
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            while height[i] < height[stack[-1]]:
                h = height[stack.pop()] # stack.pop() is the right bound
                w = i - stack[-1] - 1 # stack[-1] is the left bound
                ans = max(ans, h * w)
            stack.append(i)
        height.pop()
        return ans
```
