A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).


Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

For example, the numbers “69”, “88”, and “818” are all strobogrammatic.

#
>* Rotating  for 180 degress = reverse the list and replace 6 with 9, replace 9 with 6
```python
class Solution:
    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num: str) -> bool:
        ans = ""
        for s in n:
	    if s not in "01689":
                return False
            if s == "6": ans += "9"
            elif s == "9":ans += "6"
            else: ans += s
        return n == ans[::-1]

```
