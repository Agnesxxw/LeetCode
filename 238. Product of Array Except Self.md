Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

**Example:**
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
```
**Note: **Please solve it without division and in O(n).

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

>* ```nums[i]``` divided nums into two parts, ```nums[:i]``` and ```nums[i + 1 : ]```
>* ```answer[i]``` contains the product of all the elements to the left, for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left, so the answer[0] would be 1
>* R contains the product of all the elements to the right,for the element at index 'length - 1', there are no elements to the right, so the R would be 1

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        results = []
        left,right = 1,1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            results.append(left)
            left *= nums[i]
        for i in range(len(nums)-1,-1,-1):
            results[i] = results[i] * right
            right *= nums[i]
        return results
```
