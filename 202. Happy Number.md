Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

**Example: **
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

# Hash Set

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        ans=set()
        ans.add(n)
        while n!=1:
            n=sum(int(i) ** 2 for i in list(str(n)))
            #print(ans)
            if n in ans:
                return False
            else:
                ans.add(n)
        return True
```

# Slow Fast Pointer
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        slow, fast = n, n
        slow = self.bitSum(slow)
        fast = self.bitSum(fast)
        fast = self.bitSum(fast)
        while slow != fast:
            slow = self.bitSum(slow)
            fast = self.bitSum(fast)
            fast = self.bitSum(fast)
        return slow == 1
        
    def bitSum(self, n):
        res = 0
        while n != 0:
            res += (n % 10) ** 2
            n = n // 10
        return res
```
