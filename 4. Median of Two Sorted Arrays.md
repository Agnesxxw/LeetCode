There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**.

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
**Example 1:**
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
**Example 2:**
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
## O(log)-> Binary Search

Cutting A in index i, cutting B in index j:
```
      left_part          |        right_part
A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]  |  A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[m-1]
B[0], B[1], ..., B[j-1]  |  B[j], B[j+1], ..., B[n-1]
```
If we can ensure:
```
1) len(left_part) == len(right_part)
2) max(left_part) <= min(right_part)
```
then we divide all elements in {A, B} into two parts with equal length, and one part is always greater than the other. 
```
median = (max(left_part) + min(right_part))/2.
```
To ensure these two conditions, we just need to ensure:
```
(1) i + j == m - i + n - j (or: m - i + n - j + 1)
    if n >= m, we just need to set: i = 0 ~ m, j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i
(2) B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j] (Since A and B are sorted)
```
For simplicity, I presume A[i-1],B[j-1],A[i],B[j] are always valid even if i=0/i=m/j=0/j=n . I will talk about how to deal with these edge values at last.
So, all we need to do is:
```
Searching i in [0, m], to find an object `i` that:
    B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j], ( where j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i )
```

## Discussion: Why n >= m? 
Because I have to make sure j is non-nagative since 0 <= i <= m and j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i. If n < m , then j may be nagative, that will lead to wrong result.

```python
def median(A, B):
    m, n = len(A), len(B)
    if m > n:
        A, B, m, n = B, A, n, m
    if n == 0:
        raise ValueError

    imin, imax, half_len = 0, m, (m + n + 1) / 2
    while imin <= imax:
        i = (imin + imax) / 2
        j = half_len - i
        if i < m and B[j-1] > A[i]:
            # i is too small, must increase it
            imin = i + 1
        elif i > 0 and A[i-1] > B[j]:
            # i is too big, must decrease it
            imax = i - 1
        else:
            # i is perfect

            if i == 0: max_of_left = B[j-1]
            elif j == 0: max_of_left = A[i-1]
            else: max_of_left = max(A[i-1], B[j-1])

            if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
                return max_of_left

            if i == m: min_of_right = B[j]
            elif j == n: min_of_right = A[i]
            else: min_of_right = min(A[i], B[j])

            return (max_of_left + min_of_right) / 2.0
```
```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        a, b, m = *sorted((nums1, nums2), key=len), (len(nums1) + len(nums2) - 1) // 2
        self.__class__.__getitem__ = lambda self, i: m-i-1 < 0 or a[i] >= b[m-i-1]
        i = bisect.bisect_left(self, True, 0, len(a))
        r = sorted(a[i:i+2] + b[m-i:m-i+2])
        return (r[0] + r[1 - (len(a) + len(b)) % 2]) / 2
```
