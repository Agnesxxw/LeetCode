Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
**Example:**
```
Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
# 
>* Start at the left bottom and shrink the area step by step
```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        if len(matrix) == 0 or len(matrix[0]) == 0:
            return False
        height, width = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

        row = height-1
        col = 0

        while col < width and row >= 0:
            if matrix[row][col] > target:
                row -= 1
            elif matrix[row][col] < target:
                col += 1
            else: 
                return True
        
        return False
```
