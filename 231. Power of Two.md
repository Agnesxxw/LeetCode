Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: 218
Output: false
```
# bit calculation
>* ```n&(n-1)```can make the last bit of n become 0
>* if a number is the power of two, its binaray only have one 1 and others are all zeros, so ```n&(n-1)=0```
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0  
```
