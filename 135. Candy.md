There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

# Double pointer
>* What most important here is to find the length of each descending sequence, so can determine the minimum peak value

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        left_to_right = [1] * n
        right_to_left = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                left_to_right[i] = left_to_right[i - 1] + 1
        #print(left_to_right)
        for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[j] > ratings[j + 1]:
                right_to_left[j] = max(right_to_left[j + 1] + 1, left_to_right[j + 1])
        #print(right_to_left)
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += max(left_to_right[i], right_to_left[i])
        return res
        
```
# Update

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        if n == 0: return 0
        candy_nums = [1] * n

        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candy_nums[i] = candy_nums[i - 1] + 1

        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            if ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i]:
                candy_nums[i - 1] = max(candy_nums[i - 1], candy_nums[i] + 1)
        return sum(candy_nums)
