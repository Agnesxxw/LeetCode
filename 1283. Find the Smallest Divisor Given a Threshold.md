Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a positive integer divisor and divide all the array by it and sum the result of the division. Find the smallest divisor such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to threshold.
```
Each result of division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).
```
It is guaranteed that there will be an answer.

>* As the divisor increasing, the sum of ```num[i] / d ```is decreasing
>* Choose domain[l, r], and choose one divisor d' inside this domain, calculate the total, so two circumstances will occur:
>> 1. ```total' > threshold```, so ```[l, d']``` no longer have valid divisor, find the divisor in ```[d', r]```
>> 2. ```total' <= threshold```, which means d' meet the requriements, but as it requires the minimum divisor, we can ignore the domain in ``` [d', r]```, and keep looking in ```[l, d']```
>8 So how to decide the domain? fist, the left is 1, the right can be set to max(nums), since when ```d >= max(nums)```, the result is 1 for each element, ```total = len(nums)```, so in this case ```max(nums)``` is the solution
```python
class Solution:
    import math
    def smallestDivisor(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        if sum(nums) <= threshold: return 1
        l, r, ans = 1, max(nums) + 1, -1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            total = sum((x - 1) // mid + 1 for x in nums)
            if total <= threshold:
                ans = mid
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return ans

```
