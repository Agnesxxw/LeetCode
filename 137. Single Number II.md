Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
# Dict
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        d = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in d:
                d[num] = 1
            else:
                d[num] += 1
        for key in d:
            if d[key] == 1:
                return key
```
# Update
>* ```3 × (a + b + c) − (a + a + a + b + b + b + c) = 2c```
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return (3 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)) // 2
```
# Update
```
∼x: NOT

x&y: AND

x⊕y: XOR(x^y), 0^x = x, x^ x = 0, x^x^x = x
So only when numbers exists for odd times will its XOR != 0
```

>>* When seen_once unchanged, change seen_twice
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen_once = seen_twice = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            # first appearance: 
            # add num to seen_once 
            # don't add to seen_twice because of presence in seen_once
            
            # second appearance: 
            # remove num from seen_once 
            # add num to seen_twice
            
            # third appearance: 
            # don't add to seen_once because of presence in seen_twice
            # remove num from seen_twice
            seen_once = ~seen_twice & (seen_once ^ num)
            seen_twice = ~seen_once & (seen_twice ^ num)

        return seen_once
