Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

Return the linked list sorted as well.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1->2->3->3->4->4->5
Output: 1->2->5
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 1->1->1->2->3
Output: 2->3
```

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        head2 = ListNode(0)
        p = head2

        while head:
            if head.next and head.next.val == head.val:
                val = head.val
                while head and head.val == val:
                    head = head.next
                # to prevent when the elements are all the same at the end of linked list, the new linked list's end point.next is not none
                p.next = head
            else:
                p.next = head
                p = head
                head = head.next
        return head2.next
