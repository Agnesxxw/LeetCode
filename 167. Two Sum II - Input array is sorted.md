Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
**Example:**
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        if len(numbers) == 0: return None
        left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        res = []
        while left < right:
            if numbers[left] + numbers[right] == target:
                res.append(left + 1)
                res.append(right + 1)
                return res
            elif numbers[left] + numbers[right] < target:
                left += 1
            elif numbers[left] + numbers[right]  > target:
                right -= 1
```
