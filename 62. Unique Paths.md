A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?
**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

```
# DP
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
    
        dp = [[1] * m for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(1,n):
            for j in range(1,m):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
                
        return dp[-1][-1]
	
```
# Factorial
>* Observe that for a m by n grid, robot will always make ```(m-1)``` moves to the right, and ```(n-1)``` moves down for a total of ```(m+n-2)``` moves. The number of possible paths the robot can take is then the binomial coefficient ```B(m+n-2,m-1) = factorial(m+n-2)/(factorial(m-1)*factorial(n-1))```

```python
from math import factorial as fact
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
    
        return fact(m + n - 2) // (fact(m - 1)*fact(n - 1))      
```
