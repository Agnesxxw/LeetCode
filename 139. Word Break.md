Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        if not wordDict: return not s
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in wordDict:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        return dp[-1]
