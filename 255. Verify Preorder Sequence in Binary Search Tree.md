Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Follow up: Could you do it using only constant space complexity?

```python
class Solution:
    def verifyPreorder(self, preorder: List[int]) -> bool:
        stack = []
        new_min = float('-inf')  
        for i in range(len(preorder)):
            if preorder[i] < new_min: return False
            while stack and preorder[i] > stack[-1]: # pop all the element that is smaller than current element, the last element popped out is the root of this element
                new_min = stack.pop()
            stack.append(preorder[i])
        return True
```
