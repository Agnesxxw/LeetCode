Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**
```
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```
# slow and fast pointer
>* ```while fast != last adn fast.next != last : slow = slow.next; fast = fast.next.next``` to find the mid item of an linked list
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
        def findmid(head, last):
            slow = head
            fast = head
            while fast != last and fast.next != last:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
            return slow
        
        def helper(head, last):
            if head == last: return 
            node = findmid(head, last)
            Tree = TreeNode(node.val)
            Tree.left = helper(head, node)
            Tree.right = helper(node.next, last)
            return Tree

        return helper(head, None)
```
