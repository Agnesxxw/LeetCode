Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
**Example1**
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
**Example2**
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## DP
The basic idea is that for any string, if the head and tail are the same, then its longest palindrome substring must be the longest palindrome substring removing the head and tail, plus the head and tail. If the head and tail are different, then its longest palindrome substring is max(the longest palindrome substring of the headless part, the longest palindrome substring of the tailless part).
```
dp[i,j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and (dp[i+1,jâˆ’1])
 
dp[i,j] = 0 if (s[i] != s[j])
```
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        if s is None:
            return ''
        ret = ''
        lens = len(s)
        max = 0
        dp = [[0] * lens for i in range(lens)]
        
        for j in range(lens):
            for i in range(j + 1):# check all substring end with j
                dp[i][j] = (( s[i] == s[j] ) and (j - i <= 2 or dp[i + 1][j - 1])) 
 
                if dp[i][j] and j - i + 1 > max:
                    max = j - i + 1
                    ret = s[i:j + 1]
        return ret
```
### Discussion:j - i <= 2
j - i <= 2 includes three situations: i = j, j = i + 1; j = i + 2;
1. i - j = 0: dp[i][i] must be true;
2. i - j = 1: s[i] and s[j] are adjacent, and they are the same, so its a palindrome substring
3. i - j = 2: s[i] == s[j]m no matter what element in the center, its a palindrome substring
