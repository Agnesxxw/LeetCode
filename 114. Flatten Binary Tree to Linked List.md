Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
```
For example, given the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```
# Preorder transverse
>* keep track the parent node
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        if not root: return []
        stack= [root]
        prev = None
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if prev:
                prev.right = node
                prev.left = None

            if node:
                stack.append(node.right)
                stack.append(node.left)
                prev = node
```
