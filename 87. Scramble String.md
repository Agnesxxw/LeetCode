Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":
```
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".
```
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```
We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".
```
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
```
We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".

Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false
```

# Recursive
>* if ```s1[:i]``` can be scrambled into ```s2[:i]``` and ```s1[i:]``` can be scrambled into ```s2[i :]```, return True
>* Also, ```s1[:i]``` can first be scrambled to ```s1 = s1[i:] + s1[:i]```, so if ```s1[:i]``` can be scrambled into ```s2[i:]``` and ```s1[i:]``` can be scrambled into ```s2[:i]```, return True
```python
class Solution:
    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if( s1==s2):return True
        if sorted(s1)!=sorted(s2):return False
        for i in range(1,len(s1)):
      
            a=self.isScramble(s1[:i],s2[:i])
            b=self.isScramble(s1[i:],s2[i:])
            if a and b:return True
            a=self.isScramble(s1[i:],s2[:-i])
            b=self.isScramble(s1[:i],s2[-i:])
     
            if a and b:return True
        return False
       
```
# DP
>* dp[i][j][length] corresponding to s1 starts with ith, s2 starts with jth, length means starting from i and j with length. So when length = 1, ```dp[i][j][1]``` should be true if ```s[i] == s[j]```, otherwise, false

```python
class Solution:
    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        l = len(s1)
        if l != len(s2): return False
        dp = [[None for _ in range(l)] for _ in range(l)]
        for i in range(l):
            for j in range(l):
                dp[i][j] = [False] * (min(l-i, l-j)+1)
        for i in range(l):
            for j in range(l):
                dp[i][j][1] = s1[i] == s2[j]
        for length in range(2, l+1):
            for i in range(l-length+1):
                for j in range(l-length+1):
                    for sep in range(1, length): # check
 the way it split, sep is the split point
                        if dp[i][j][sep] and dp[i+sep][j+sep][length - sep]:      # when two previous layers 
 havn't been exchanged
                            dp[i][j][length] = True
                            break
                        if dp[i][j+length-sep][sep] and dp[i+sep][j][length-sep]: # when two previous layers 
 have been exchanged
                            dp[i][j][length] = True
                            break
        return dp[0][0][l]

```
