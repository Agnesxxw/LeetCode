Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

**For example:**
```
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
```
**Hint:**
```
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], what should your return? Is this case a valid tree?
According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

# Union Find
>* if start from a node in teh graph, can reach any node , and no cycle, this graph can be a tree
>* So find if there is only one root
>* if tehre is a cycle
>* Union find is to put the connected nodes within one group, if the searcheing node pair are in teh different group, this means that they are not connected
```
[(4, 3), (3, 8), (6, 5), (9, 4), (2, 1), (8, 9), (5, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (6, 7)]
first group each node in 1,2,3,....
(3,4) -> 3, and 4 should belong to one group, so set the group number 3(or 4)
```
```python
class UnionFindSet(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.count = n
        self.roots = [i for i in range(n)]
        
    def find(self, node):
        while self.roots[node] != node:
            node = self.roots[node]
        return node
    
    def union(self, p, q):
        p_parent = self.find(p)
        print("p_parent", p_parent)
        q_parent = self.find(q)
        print("q_parent", q_parent)
        self.roots[p_parent] = q_parent
        self.count -= 1
        
class Solution(object):
    def validTree(self, n, edges):
    
        #开并查集，如果一条边的两个顶点在放进图之前就有相同的根结点，则说明这条边放进去之后会形成一个环
        ufs = UnionFindSet(n)
        for start, end in edges:
            if ufs.find(start) == ufs.find(end):
                return False
            ufs.union(start, end)
        # print ufs.count
        return ufs.count == 1

        if self.vis.count(1) != n or self.cycle: # not all the node are scanned -> not connected
