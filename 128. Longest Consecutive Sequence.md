Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

**Example:**
```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

# Set()
>* set() realize O(1) search
>* ```
if num - 1 not in nums:
                tmp = 1
```
ensures we only start search when this is the smallest element of the sub-sequence
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = set(nums)
        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 not in nums:
                tmp = 1
                while num + 1 in nums:
                    num += 1
                    tmp += 1
                res = max(res, tmp)
        return res
```

# Hashmap
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        lookup = {}
        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num not in lookup:
                # check if leftside and rightside can be connected
                left = lookup[num - 1] if num - 1 in lookup else 0
                right = lookup[num + 1] if num + 1 in lookup else 0
                # record the length
                lookup[num] = left + right + 1
                # set the head and tail to the longest length
                lookup[num - left] = left + right + 1
                lookup[num + right] = left + right + 1
                res = max(res, left + right + 1)
        return res
