Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```
Note:

-100.0 < x < 100.0
n is a 32-bit signed integer, within the range [−2^31^, 2^31^ − 1]

# Bit shifting
>* Shifting all the bits ```1``` to the right ```(m >>= 1)``` has the effect of cutting an integer in half and dropping the remainder. 
>* The bitwise and ```(m & 1)``` basically compares the last bit in ```m``` with the single bit in ```1```, and if they're both ```1``` then it evaluates to ```1``` (otherwise it evaluates to ```0```). So odd ```m``` will evaluate to ```1``` (or True), and even m will evaluate to ```0``` (or False).
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        m = abs(n)
        ans = 1.0
        while m:
            if m & 1: # Check whether m is odd or even, odd -> 1, evem -> 0
                ans *= x
            x *= x
            m >>= 1 # m //= 2
        return ans if n >= 0 else 1 / ans
```
## update
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n
        pow = 1
        while n:
            if n % 2:
                pow *= x
            x *= x
            n //= 2
        return pow
```
