Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example**:
```
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

# fast and slow pointer
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        ls = len(s)
        # slow and fast pointers
        slow = -1
        # iterate over trailing spaces
        while slow >= -ls and s[slow] == ' ':
            slow-=1 # in case there are spaces in the end of the string
        fast = slow
        # iterate over last word
        while fast >= -ls and s[fast] != ' ':
            fast-=1
        return slow - fast
```
