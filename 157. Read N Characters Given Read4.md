The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: buf = “abc”, n = 4
Output: “abc”
Explanation: The actual number of characters read is 3, which is “abc”.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: buf = “abcde”, n = 5 
Output: “abcde”
```

```python
"""
The read4 API is already defined for you.

    @param buf, a list of characters
    @return an integer
    def read4(buf):

# Below is an example of how the read4 API can be called.
file = File("abcdefghijk") # File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
buf = [' '] * 4 # Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file
