The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
```1``` is read off as "one 1" or ```11```.
```11``` is read off as "two 1s" or ```21```.
```21``` is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or ```1211```.

Given an integer n where 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        l = '1'# first line is defined
        for j in range(1, n):
            cur, start, count = "", l[0], 0
            for j in l:
                if j == start:
                    count += 1
                else:# start a new cycle of counting
                    cur += str(count) + start
                    count = 1
                    start = j
            cur += str(count) + start
            l = cur
        return l
