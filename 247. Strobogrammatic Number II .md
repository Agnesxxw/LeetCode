A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.
```
For example,
Given n = 2, returnÂ ["11","69","88","96"]
```
# Double Pointer and Backtrace
>* Initialize the ```tmp``` with ```length = n```
```python
class Solution:
    def findStrobogrammatic(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        def helper(left, right, tmp = [None] * n, res = tuple()):
            if left > right: return ("".join(tmp),)
            for k, v in (('0', '0'), ('1', '1'), ('6', '9'), ('8', '8'), ('9', '6')):
                if not left and right and k == '0' or left == right and k != v: continue
                tmp[left], tmp[right] = k, v
                res += helper(left + 1, right - 1)
            return res
        return helper(0, n - 1)
```
