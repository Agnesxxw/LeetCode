Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: tis "ece" which its length is 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: tis "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```
# Sliding Window
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n < 3: return n
        res = ""
        left, right = 0, 0
        hashMap = defaultdict(int)
        max_len = 2
        while right < n:
            if len(hashMap) < 3:
                hashMap[s[right]] = right
                right += 1
            if len(hashMap) == 3:
                # delete the leftmost character
                del_idx = min(hashMap.values()) # the delete item's index (should be the minimum one in current hashMap)
                del hashMap[s[del_idx]]
                # move left pointer of the slidewindow
                left = del_idx + 1

            max_len = max(max_len, right - left)

        return max_len
