Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
**Example 1:**
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
# DP
>* Suppose ```dp[i][j]``` records the edit distance between ```word1[:i]``` and ```word2[:j]```. And now we proceed to ```word1[i]``` and ```word2[j]```.

>* If they are equal, then edit distance between ```word1[:i+1]``` and ```word2[:j+1]``` are the same as ```dp[i][j]```. Or ```dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j]```.
>* Otherwise, we need to determine which of "delete", "insert", "replace" produces the lowest edit distance. Since each operation cost 1 distance, "delete"'s cost is 1 extra distance plus edit distance between ```word1[:i] ```and ```word2[:j+1]``` as we delete ```word1[i]```. Or ```dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j+1]+1```. Similiarly, "insert" produces ```dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i+1][j]+1``` and "replace" produces ```dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j]+1```. And we just pick the minimum from these three.
>* Thus, our recurrsion equation is:
```dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] if word1[i]==word2[j] else min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) + 1```
>* So initially, ```dp[0][j] = j and dp[i][0] = i```
```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1, word2):
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [list(range(n + 1))] + [[r + 1] + [0] * n for r in range(m)]
        print(dp)
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j] if word1[i] == word2[j] else min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j + 1], dp[i + 1][j]) + 1
        return dp[m][n] 
```
## update
>* implement a rolling1D DP since only two rows of DP table are actually used. So space complexity could be reduced to ```O(min(m,n))```:

```python
def minDistance(word1, word2):
	m, n = len(word1), len(word2)  # switch word1 and word2 if m < n to ensure n â‰¤ m
	curr = list(range(n+1))
	for i in range(m):
		prev, curr = curr, [i+1] + [0] * n
		for j in range(n):
			curr[j+1] = prev[j] if word1[i] == word2[j] else min(curr[j], prev[j], prev[j+1]) + 1
	return curr[n]
```
