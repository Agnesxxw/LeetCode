Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times ```[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei)```, find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

For example,
```
Given [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]],
return 2.
```
# Heap Priority Queue
>* Thw original method is that once a new meeting start, scann all created rooms, check if there is a vacancy;
>* Keep all the rooms in the small heap, the key is the end time if the meeting, so that we only need to check the heap zenith, since its the quickest meeting that will end 
>* if the prevvious room is available, pop the zenith to update the endTime
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        if not intervals:
            return 0
        # heap
        free_rooms = []
        intervals.sort(key= lambda x: x[0])
        # Add the first meeting. We have to give a new room to the first meeting.
        heapq.heappush(free_rooms, intervals[0][1])
        for i in intervals[1:]:

            # If the room due to free up the earliest is free, assign that room to this meeting.
            if free_rooms[0] <= i[0]:
                heapq.heappop(free_rooms)

            # If a new room is to be assigned, then also we add to the heap,
            # If an old room is allocated, then also we have to add to the heap with updated end time.
            heapq.heappush(free_rooms, i[1]) # put it on the zenith (leftpush)

        # The size of the heap tells us the minimum rooms required for all the meetings.
        return len(free_rooms)
