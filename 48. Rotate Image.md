ou are given an ```n x n``` 2D matrix representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example 1:**
```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```
# Regular method
>* first exchange the ith row and n - 1 - ith row
>* then exchange element in symmetric of i = j
>* TOO SLOW
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        # first exchange the ith row and n - 1 - ith row
        if not matrix: return matrix
        n = len(matrix)
        for i in range(n // 2): 
                matrix[i], matrix[n - 1 - i] = matrix[n - 1 - i], matrix[i]
                
        # then exchange element in symmetric of i = j
        for i in range(n): 
            for j in range(i, n): # only scan the upper right side
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]       
```
# Multiple layers
>* it can be devided into multiple layers as shown below: Three layers with n = 6: ``` 0th -> #; 1st -> .; 2nd -> -```
```
               1st layer:                       north
# # # # # #       	b r g b
# . . . . #       	g     r
# . - - . #	  	r     g
# . - - . #	  	b g r b
# . . . . #
# # # # # #
                                                south
```
>* int((n+1)/2) layers in total need to be rotated -> range of i
>* The outer most Layer is the 0th, then 1st, ...
>* Layer i, its sideLength is (n-2*i)
>* Each Layer has 4 sides
>* Layer ith each side has (sideLength-1) nodes (=( n-2*i-1)nodes) -> range of j
>* Each node has 3 "brothers" on the other 3 sides
>* So we go layer by layer, iteratively update each node with same color ```north -> east, east -> south, south -> west```
