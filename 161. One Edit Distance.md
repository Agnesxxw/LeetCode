Given two strings s and t, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.

**Note:** 
```
There are 3 possiblities to satisify one edit distance apart:

Insert a character into s to get t
Delete a character from s to get t
Replace a character of s to get t
```
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cab", t = "ad"
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1203", t = "1213"
Output: true
Explanation: We can replace '0' with '1' to get t.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isOneEditDistance(self, s, t):      
        distance = len(s) - len(t)
        if abs(distance) > 1: 
            return False
        if not s or not t: #one None -> true, two none -> False
            return s != t
        
        edit = 0 
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]: 
                i += 1 
                j += 1
            else:
                if edit: # the only chance is used
                    return False
                if distance == 1: # delete
                    i += 1
                elif distance == -1:# insert
                    j += 1
                else: # replace
                    i += 1
                    j += 1
                edit += 1
 
        if i < len(s): 
            return edit == 0
        if j < len(t):
            return edit == 0
        
        return i == len(s) and j == len(t) and edit == 1 


```
