Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

**Example:**
```
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”
Output: 1
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
Output: 3
```
**Note:**
You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def shortestWordDistance(self, words: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, word in enumerate(words):
            d[word].append(idx)
        self.d = d
        index1, index2 = d[word1], d[word2]
        if word1 == word2:
            dis = len(words)
            for i in range(len(index1) - 1):
                dis = min((index1[1 + i] - index1[i]), dis)
        else:
            dis = abs(index1[0] - index2[0])
            for i in index1:
                f = None
                for j in index2:
                    now = abs(j - i)
                    if(f != None and now > f): break # the difference will become larger absolutely
                    f = now
                    dis = min(dis, now)
        return dis
