Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**
```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```
Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

# Sliding window & Hash
>* Use hash table m to record how many times each element in t appears
>*  whenever encountering a desired element, the corresponding element in the hashmap  - 1, ```count = len(t)```, ```count -= 1```, ```right += 1```, When count = 0. it means all elements are found
>* Compare the minimum length, to decide whetehr replace or not. Then right shift the window with left.
>* if ```nums[left]``` is in t, ```m[nums[left]]``` should + 1, since it no longer within the window, so does ```count -= 1```(if ```m[nums[left]] > 0```, means teh window doesn't find all element)

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        left, right, m, res, minilenth, count = 0, 0, {}, "", len(s) + 1, 0
        if len(s) < len(t): return res
        for _ in t:
            m[_] = m.get(_, 0) + 1
        
        while right < len(s):
            if s[right] in m:
                m[s[right]] -= 1
                if m[s[right]] >= 0:
                    count += 1
                while (count == len(t)):
                    if right + 1 - left < minilenth:
                        minilenth = right + 1 - left
                        res = s[left : right + 1]
                    if s[left] in m:
                        m[s[left]] += 1
                        if m[s[left]] > 0:
                            count -= 1
                    left += 1
            right += 1
        return res
