Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```
# Bucket Sort

>* Put different nums in the bucket with ```interval = nums[i] // (t+1)```, so that the element in each bucket has difference < t
>* also, there maybe previous or next bucket that make the diffrence < t
>* when i == k: delete teh bucket with ```index = nums[i-k]//(t+1)``` so ensure that, when current is i + 1th element, the smallest index is ```i - k + 1```

```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int, t: int) -> bool:
        bucket = dict()
        if t < 0: return False
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nth = nums[i] // (t + 1)
            if nth in bucket:
                return True
            if nth - 1 in bucket and abs(nums[i] - bucket[nth - 1]) <= t:
                return True
            if nth + 1 in bucket and abs(nums[i] - bucket[nth + 1]) <= t:
                return True
            bucket[nth] = nums[i]
            if i >= k: bucket.pop(nums[i - k] // (t + 1))
        return False
```
