Write a program to find the nth
 ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
# Triple Pointers & DP
>* use three popinters, representing multiplied by 2, 3, 5 respectively
>* Choose the minimum at each time, and move that pointer
```python
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        nums = [1]
        i2 = i3 = i5 = 0
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            v = min(nums[i2] * 2, nums[i3] * 3, nums[i5] * 5)
            nums.append(v)

            while nums[i2] * 2 <= v:
                i2 += 1
            while nums[i3] * 3 <= v:
                i3 += 1
            while nums[i5] * 5 <= v:
                i5 += 1
        return nums[-1]
