Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**
```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
```
**Note:**

Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

# Successive iteration

>* At the first line dummy = jump = ListNode(0), both dummy and jump point to the same ListNode(0) object.

>* jump.next, jump, l = pre, l, r, basically assign three variables. First is assigning jump.next = pre. This is equivalent to assign ListNode(0).next = new head after this first iteration. At this point, dummy still point to ListNode(0). So dummy.next points to the new head after this first iteration.

>* As the iterations going on, jump is assigned to other nodes in each iteration. So jump.next is manipulating other nodes not the ListNode(0). Meanwhile, dummy still point to ListNode(0). So dummy.next always points to the new head after the first iteration.

>* Why do we need this in second line dummy.next = head?
Just in case the original list has less than k nodes. This will make sure when you return dummy.next, you return the head of the original list, instead of returning None.

>* If you break the first line to two lines like this:
```python
dummy = ListNode(0)
jump = ListNode(0)
```
>* The logic won't work, because dummy and jump now point to different ListNode.

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head or k == 1: return head
        dummy = next_head = ListNode(None)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = curr = head

        while True:
            count = 0
            while curr and count < k:
                count += 1
                curr = curr.next
            if count == k:
                h, t = curr, prev   # assign the first node of next k-group and the first node of current k-group to h(ead), t(ail)
                for _ in range(k):   # this is NOT a standard reversing by swapping arrows between adjacent nodes
                    tmp = t.next     # instead it poplefts a node successively (ref. Campanula's comment)
                    t.next = h
                    h = t
                    t = tmp
                    # one-line implementation: t.next, t, h = h, t.next, t
                next_head.next = h   # connect the last node of the previous reversed k-group to the head of the current reversed k-group
                next_head = prev     # prepare for connecting to the next to-be-reversed k-group
                prev = curr   # head of the next yet to be reversed k-group
            else:   # curr = None and count does not reach k i.e. list is exhausted
                return dummy.next
