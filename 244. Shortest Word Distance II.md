Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 

**Example:**
```
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```
# 
>* since the index list are all ordered, we can avoid the unnecesssary calculation of the difference distance by checking the trend of the difference
```python
class WordDistance:
    from collections import defaultdict
    def __init__(self, words: List[str]):
        d = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, word in enumerate(words):
            d[word].append(idx)
        self.d = d

    def shortest(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        idxs1 = self.d[word1]
        idxs2 = self.d[word2]
        dis = abs(idxs1[0] - idxs2[0])
        for i in idxs1:
            f = None
            for j in idxs2:
                now = abs(j - i)
                if(f != None and now > f): break
                f = now
                dis = min(dis, now)
        return dis

# Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordDistance(words)
# param_1 = obj.shortest(word1,word2)
```
