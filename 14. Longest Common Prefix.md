Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
**Example1**
```
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
**Example2**
```
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```
#
>* The common prefix must be determined by the shortest string, so ```zip()``` here is suitable.
>* Then use ```set()``` to check if all the letters within a tuple is the same
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        l = list(zip(*strs))
        #strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
        #l = list(zip(*strs))
        #>>> l = [('f', 'f', 'f'), ('l', 'l', 'l'), ('o', 'o', 'i'), ('w', 'w', 'g')]
        prefix = ""
        for i in l: # i is the tuple element
            if len(set(i))==1: # all the elements in tuple are the same-> common prefix
                prefix += i[0]
            else:
                break
        return prefix
```


# zip()
>* The zip()function returns an **iterator** of tuples based on the iterable objects.
>* If we do not pass any parameter, zip() returns an empty iterator
>* If a single iterable is passed, zip() returns an iterator of tuples with each tuple having only one element.
>* If multiple iterables are passed, zip() returns an iterator of tuples with each tuple having elements from all the iterables.
>* Suppose, two iterables are passed to zip(); one iterable containing three and other containing five elements. Then, the returned iterator will contain three tuples. It's because iterator stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted.
>* zip(*)can zip tuple into lists, contradiction of zip()
```python
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]


list(zip(a))
Out[414]: [([1, 2, 3],), ([4, 5, 6],), ([7, 8, 9],)]

#with*
list(zip(*a))
Out[415]: [(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]

#equals to
m = [1, 2, 3]; n = [4, 5, 6]; q = [7, 8, 9]

list(zip(m,n,q))
Out[417]: [(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]

#unzip
a, b, c = zip(*zip(m,n,q))

list(a)
Out[419]: [1, 2, 3]
list(b)
Out[420]: [4, 5, 6]
list(c)
Out[421]: [7, 8, 9]
```
# set()
>* Syntax : set(iterable)
>* Parameters : Any iterable sequence like list, tuple or dictionary.
>* Returns : An empty set if no element is passed. **Sorted**, **non-repeating** element iterable modified as passed as argument.
