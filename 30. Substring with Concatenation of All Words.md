You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```
# Sliding Window
>* Using a counter and a sliding window, we push the window from left to right, counting the number of valid words in the window. 
>* when meet reuse of the word, ```counter -= 1```
>* When the number of a word in the window is more than the times it appears in words or we meet a invalid word, push the window.

**dict is quite useful when dealing with substring problems**
