Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag

babgbag

# DP

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        n1 = len(s)
        n2 = len(t)
        dp = [[0] * (n1 + 1) for _ in range(n2 + 1)]
        for j in range(n1 + 1):
            dp[0][j] = 1
        print(dp)
        for i in range(1, n2 + 1):
            for j in range(1, n1 + 1):
                if t[i - 1] == s[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]  + dp[i][j - 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
        #print(dp)
        return dp[-1][-1]
