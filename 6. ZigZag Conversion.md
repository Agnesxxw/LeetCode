The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```
**Example1**
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:

P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```
## Simulates the process of writing a zigzag string. 
1. Define an array with numRows elements, each element is initially an empty string, representing the initial situation of numRows line strings; 
2. Then scan the input string s, and add each character to the end of the corresponding line string in turn; 
3. Finally The result is obtained by concatenating all the line strings.

Note that % operation is used in the code to determine whether it is time to write the zigzag character in another direction(col).

```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:

        if numRows <= 1 or numRows >= len(s):
            return s
        arr = [''] * numRows
        line, step = 0, -1 # step = 
        for c in s:
            arr[line] += c
            if line % (numRows-1) == 0: # reach the bottom or 0th line, turn to next col
                step = - step
            line += step
        return ''.join(arr) #The join() method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string
```
