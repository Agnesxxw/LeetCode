Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```
# Stack
>* The same as 84, do the max area calculation in each row
```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0
        
        def calArea(heights):
            heights = [0] + heights + [0]
            stack = []
            maxArea = 0
            for i, h in enumerate(heights):
                while(stack and heights[stack[-1]] > h):
                    j = stack.pop()
                    maxArea = max(maxArea, (i-stack[-1]-1)*heights[j])
                stack.append(i)
            return maxArea
        
        heights = [0] * len(matrix[0])
        ret = 0
        
        for row in matrix:
            for i, v in enumerate(row):
                heights[i] = heights[i]+1 if v == '1' else 0
            maA = calArea(heights)
            ret = max(ret, maA)
            
            
        return ret
           
```
