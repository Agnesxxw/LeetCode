Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,6,9,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either
             (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.
```
**Note:**

You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
Try to solve it in **linear** time/space.
# Bucket Sort
>* The maximum gap between adjacent element must **larger or euqal** than ```capacity = [(max - mini) / (n - 1)]```, n is the number of element in the ```nums```, so max distance is between adjacent bucket
>* Put the gap of adjacent element  that smaller than ```[(max - mini) / (n - 1)]``` in one bucket, thus, the maximum gap is generated between adjacent bucket
>* How to determin which bucket should the element be placed? let ```[(max - mini) / (n - 1)]``` represents which bucket the element should be placed (how many gaps does it have towards min)
>* The bucket capacity is ```[(max - mini) / (n - 1)]```ï¼Œ distance betwen adjacent bucket: min of next bucket - max of current bucket
>* If one bucket is empty, go forwards until it's not empty

class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, nums) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return 0
        max_num, min_num = max(nums), min(nums)
        cap = math.ceil((max_num - min_num) / (len(nums)-1))
        if cap == 0:
            return 0
        k = (max_num - min_num) // cap + 1 # total number of buckets
        bucket = [[] for i in range(k)]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            bucket[(nums[i]-min_num) // cap].append(nums[i]) # the ith bucket's range:[min_num + capacity * i,min_num + capacity * (i + 1) ] 
        res = []
        i = 0
        while i < k-1:
            if bucket[i+1] == []:
                j = i+1
                while not bucket[j]:
                    j += 1
                res.append(min(bucket[j])-max(bucket[i]))
                i = j
            else:
                res.append(min(bucket[i+1])-max(bucket[i]))
                i += 1
        return max(res)
