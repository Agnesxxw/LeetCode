Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

**Example:**
```
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
```
# Sieve of Eratosthenes

```
A. 12 = 2 × 6
B. 12 = 3 × 4
C. 12 = sqrt(12) × sqrt(12)
D. 12 = 4 × 3
E. 12 = 6 × 2
```
>* It can be easily read that D and E are the reverse of A and B, so the boundary is sqrt(n)
>* Which means that if no factors between [2, sqrt(n)], n is a prime
>* Since any none-primes can be represented as the multiplications of primes, so filter all the multiples of primes that below sqrt(n), the left are primes

```python
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2: return 0
        isPrimes = [1] * n
        isPrimes[0] = isPrimes[1] = 0
# filter all the multiplications of primes by setting it to 0
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if isPrimes[i] == 1:
                isPrimes[i * i: n: i] = [0] * len(isPrimes[i * i: n: i])
        return sum(isPrimes)
