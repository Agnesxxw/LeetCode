Implement **next permutation**, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
```
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1

Accepted

# Two pointers
The so-called next permutation means that there is no other permutation between this permutation and the next permutation. This requires that this array and the next array have the common prefix as long as possible, that is, the change is limited to the shortest possible suffix.
>* 1. find the first (violate the increase trend)descending position i
>* 2. find the minimum value that larger than nums[i - 1], swap their values
>* 3. sort nums[i:]
