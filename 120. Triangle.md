Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
```

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.


# DP
>* **Top to down**
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(triangle)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [[0] * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = triangle[0][0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                if j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j] 
                elif j == i:
                    dp[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1] 
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])
        return min(dp[-1])
```
# Follow up
>* Since everytime we just need the previous line to update this line, so we can optimize the dp
 into one dimension, from **down to top**

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row = len(triangle)
        dp = [0] * row
        for i in range(len(triangle[-1])):
            dp[i] = triangle[-1][i]
        print(dp)
        for i in range(row - 2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j + 1]) + triangle[i][j]
                print(dp[j])
        return dp[0]          
```
