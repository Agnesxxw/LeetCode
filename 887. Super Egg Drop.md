You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N. 

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.

You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.

Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N). 

Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F is, regardless of the initial value of F?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: K = 1, N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.
If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: K = 2, N = 6
Output: 3

# DP
>* ```dp[k][n]```: k eggs, throw for minimum n times can detect dp[k][n] levels
 >* Edge cases: 1. for one egg situation, throw n times can detect n levels -> ```dp[1][n] = n```; 2. throw only one time, no matter how many eggs it has, only one level of building can be detected.
>* ```dp[k][n]```: if this egg is broken, it has ```k - 1``` eggs and ```n - 1``` times to try -> ```dp[k - 1][n - 1]```; if this egg is not broken -> has k eggs left and ```n - 1``` times to try: ```dp[k][n - 1]```; plus current level, so ```dp[k][n] = 1 + + dp[k - 1][n - 1] + dp[k][n - 1]```


```python
class Solution:
    def superEggDrop(self, K: int, N: int) -> int:
        dpTable = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(K+1)]
        m = 0
        while(dpTable[K][m] < N):
            m += 1
            for k in range(1, K+1):
                dpTable[k][m] = dpTable[k-1][m-1] + dpTable[k][m-1] +1
        return m

```
# Update
>* k eggs can try maximum at N times -> ```dp[k] < N```, thus convert a two array to one array
```python
class Solution:
    def superEggDrop(self, K: int, N: int) -> int:
        if K == 1 or N == 1:
            return N
        dp = [0 for _ in range(K+1)]
        ans = 0
        while dp[K] < N:
            for k in range(K, 0, -1):
                dp[k] = dp[k]+dp[k-1]+1
            ans += 1
        return ans
