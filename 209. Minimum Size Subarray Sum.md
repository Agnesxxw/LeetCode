Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Example: **
```
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n). 
# Sliding Window
>* whenever the sum in the sliding window is larger than s, update the minimum length.
>* Based on FIFO, move the window until sum is smaller than s
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, s: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = total = 0
        ans = len(nums) + 1
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            total += nums[r]
            while total >= s:
                ans = min(ans, r - l + 1)
                total -= nums[l]
                l += 1
        return  0 if ans == len(nums) + 1 else ans
```
