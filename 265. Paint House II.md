There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.
# DP
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostII(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0
        dp = costs
        n = len(dp)
        k =  len(dp[0])
        for i in range(1,n):    
            for x in range(0,k):
                minp = inf
                for j in range(0,k):
                    if j == x:
                        continue
                    minp = min(dp[i-1][j], minp)
                dp[i][x] += minp
        return min(dp[-1])
```

            for j in range(k):
                tmp = dp[i - 1].pop(j)
                dp[i][j] += min(dp[i - 1])
                dp[i - 1].insert(j, tmp)
        #print(dp)
        return min(dp[-1])
