Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```
Note:

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.
# HashMap
"scanning" positive number that not in nums
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hash_map={}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]>0:
                hash_map[nums[i]]=i
        j=1
        if 1 not in hash_map:
            return 1
        
        while True:
            if j not in hash_map:
                return j 
            j+=1
```
# abs()
>* Basic idea is that we mark their indexes as taken for numbers that are in range [1..n] and ignore all other numbers. The mark is a negative sign.>* 
>* You need to use abs(nums[i]) because even though you got rid of negatives in the first loop, in the second loop you are going to fill array with negatives as you mark the indexes:
```nums[pos] = -abs(nums[pos])```
>* later during the second loop you will encounter those negatives but you still have to process original non-negative values there.

>* Test case [1]: first loop will not change it, second loop will mark the correct index of 1 as negative [-1], third loop will not be able to find any free indexes, so result is n+1 = 2

class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] <= 0: nums[i] = len(nums)+1
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(nums[i]) <= n: nums[abs(nums[i])-1] = -abs(nums[abs(nums[i])-1])
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] > 0: return i+1
        return n+1
