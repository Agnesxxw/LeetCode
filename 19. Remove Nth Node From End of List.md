Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

# slow & fast pointers
>* The problem to be executed in **one pass** is that the pointer cannot know its current position 
>* so consider using fast pointers. The fast pointer is n nodes faster than the slow pointer. 
>* When the fast.next is None, it means that slow.next should be removed.
>* special case for fast == None

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        fast = slow = head
        for _ in range(n):# _ means we don't care about the variable _ we just want to do the loop.
            fast = fast.next

        if not fast:# This means that when the fast pointer is null (which is n nodes away from the slow pointer), it implies we are going to remove the slow pointer which is currently head, thus remove head and return head.next
            return head.next
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head      
```
